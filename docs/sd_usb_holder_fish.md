# SD/USB holder fish

This is based on [SD card holder fish](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1734472). As [the comment](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1734472/#comment-974176) said, someone may need an option for USB Jump Drives. 

A USB adapter is fatter and the fish need thicker segments so I published this as a new thing. 

If you don't need USB slots, you may still use [SD card holder fish](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1734472). It's slim for each segment.
