This is generalized version of [PI Sphere](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1639055). Although it's possible to calculate relative parameters, I leave more parameters so that you may customize your favorite style. 

You may simply input your own text, bottom symbol, style, top radius, bottom radius and thickness. If you want to change sphere radius or font name, try to adjust font size, char gap, floor density and top offset to make a pretty sphere.
