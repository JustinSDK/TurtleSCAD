# Golden spiral generator

It's the base of [Lotus-like flower](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1749149). 

As stated in the beginning of [Fibonacci in Nature](http://jwilson.coe.uga.edu/emat6680/parveen/fib_nature.htm), "The Fibonacci numbers are Nature's numbering system. They appear everywhere in Nature, from the leaf arrangement in plants, to the pattern of the florets of a flower, the bracts of a pinecone, or the scales of a pineapple." Once you need ideas to create a model,  the Fibonacci numbers may be a great one. 

This generator uses Fibonacci numbers to create golden spirals. Through different parameters, different beautiful effects would be generated. The featured picture here demonstrates several ones, and you may create more :)
