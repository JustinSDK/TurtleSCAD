# Text helix

While trying a double helix, I suddenly had an idea: how about adding a character? That will be funny ^^ 

Remember to set a correct font if you input non-ascii characters.

The source file generates errors when using OpenSCAD 2015-03. Downloading and using the newest development snapshot will solve problems. I used OpenSCAD 2017.01.20.

I'm not sure whether Thingiverse Customizer will also throw errors. If that happens, try to download the newest development snapshot.
