# Announce

The Japanese government announced on April 1 2019 that "Reiwa" will be the name of Japan's new era to start on May 1 2019. A service that can create and publish the "new era" arbitrarily is on [新元号ジェネレータ](https://singengo.com/). 

The thing here is a 3D-printable version of "new ear generator". The board is changeable so you may just print an announcer if you don't change the corresponding thickness. You may, of course, use a paper note, too.
