# Dragon - OpenSCAD / SculptGL

The thing here is my first attempt at combining [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/) and [SculptGL](https://stephaneginier.com/sculptgl/), an excellent browser-based sculpting app.

The dragon generated by OpenSCAD is based on [Dragon - proof of concept](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2332523). After rendering and exporting STL, I imported it into SculptGL and do some sculpting.

The file `dragon-openscad.scad` is the OpenSCAD source code. The `dragon-openscad.stl` is generated STL. The `dragon.sgl` is the exported file of SculptGL. You can import it directly into SculptGL and play it. The `dragon.stl` is the final work.
