# Soccer puzzle

This is based on [Soccer polyhedron](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1515209). After generating a model, you may split the object into parts and select a pentagon part and a hexagon part for printing.  

A soccer puzzle needs 12 pentagons and 20 hexagons. I print them in black and white. You may print them in more colors if you like.
