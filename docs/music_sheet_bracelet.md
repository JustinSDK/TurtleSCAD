# Music sheet bracelet

This is remixed from [Note-Generator](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:47677). I refactored code and turned it into a bracelet (by the same way of [Generalized zentangle bracelet](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1569263)). 

Notes may be customized. See [Instructions of Note-Generator](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:47677) for how to input notes. 

For example, the STL example here is the beginning of the song "You are my sunshine", created from the following `notestring`: 
- `4:br,4:g1,4:c2,4:d2,bar,2:e2,2:e2,bar,4:br,4:e2,#:d2,4:d2,4:e2,bar,2:c2,2:c2`

The `height` parameter means the height of the area containing notes so a higher `height` makes notes bigger. A higher `radius` may contains more notes. 

You may use the `Preview` mode to check whether the notes are right for you..
