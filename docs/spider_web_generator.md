# Spider web generator

I started learning 3D printing last year. One day, my scooter's basket was broken so I used SketchUp to make a spider web for it.

After that, I have been studying OpenSCAD for almost one year. Recently, I saw many funny things for Halloween, including some spider webs. I think, Why not creating a spider web generator?
