# Text pendant

It's based on [PI Sphere](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1639055). I got the idea from the picture.

The customizer here accepts three parameters, `chas`, `symbol` and 'char_gap'. The default `char_gap` is suitable for numbers. If you want to input alphabets,  using `char_gap` is necessary.
