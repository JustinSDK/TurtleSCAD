# Characters container generator

You may input any text to generate your own container. For example, Ï€, root of 2, and so on. 

Use the `character_container_without_projection` module if your text has more words because the module is fast.

The `character_container` module has a smoother visual effect but is slow because it uses the `projection` function internally.
