# Frog choir

Want to shout out something? Let these frogs do it for you. The members of the frog choir are different when being generated.

Thingiverse customizer doesn't support import STL so don't use the customizer online.

Even though an STL can be converted into an OpenSCAD module, this way makes the .scad file large and render slowly, especially for 8 frogs in a source.
