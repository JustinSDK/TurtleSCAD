1. It’s convenient to put some hay on the round bottom.
2. The flat top cover can be easily opened for cleaning the house.
3. The flat top cover won’t be opened if the house is fixed under the top of the birdcage. 
4. Use two rings to hang on the house.
5. The ring around the door prevents birds from being hunted by the edge. 
6. It can be printed all in once.

You may change the following parameters to create your own bird house:
- `house_radius`
- `wall_thickness`
- `hang_ring_radius`
- `door_ring_radius`
