# Text box

Input your text. The customizer will generate a box for you. Using text faces is especially cute and kids will love them. Of course, you may also input a name to generate a special gift box. 

The `font_name` should accept all the fonts from [Google](https://fonts.google.com/). If there are gaps inside the generated box, try to increase the `r_round_edge` value. 

If you want to use fonts installed on your computer, download the .scad file and change the `font_name` directly; then, use [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/index.html) to render and export the STL.
