# (8, 3) torus knot fort

I'd like to quote the description of Robert Fathauer's [Walk Torus83 Fort](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/walk-torus83-fort-44dc701f676d40f7aa1bee874db6fde9). 

> **Imagined fortified enclosure. The walkway is an (8,3) torus knot, with 16 crossings, in the form of an octagram.**

His Walk Torus83 Fort is an amazing work. I thought it can be expressed by code so used OpenSCAD to make one,as a derived thing from his work.

[Robert Fathauer's page](https://sketchfab.com/Fathauer) is worth visiting, too. You can find more awesome works in Mathematica.
