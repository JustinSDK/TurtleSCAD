# Chess set? Puzzle? Soccer? V1.1

Someone told me that [Soccer puzzle](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1534279) may be printed more easily if each piece has a flat bottom. That give me an idea. I can give the pieces of [Chess set? Puzzle? Soccer?](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1547895) a flat bottom and make them higher. They would be more like chess pieces. 

You may still put all of the pieces together as a soccer if you don't want to play chess. 

The chess symbols need the font `"MS Gothic"` so you may not use the [Customizer](http://www.thingiverse.com/apps/customizer/run?thing_id=1547895) directly. You may download .scad file and use [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/). If you want to use different chess symbols, such as [Chess symbols in Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_symbols_in_Unicode), replace symbols in the `pieces` module.
