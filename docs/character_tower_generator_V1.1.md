# Character tower generator v1.1 

I got a feature request which wants a quote on the bottom of the outside so I combine [Character tower generator](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1241377) and [Spiral Characters](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1404251) to create it.

For more information, see [Character tower generator](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1241377) directly.
