# Ball of Characters

It's based on [Spiral Characters](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1404251). You may change the following parameters to create your own ball of characters, such as Ball of PI, Ball of Primes...

- `text`
- `diameter`
- `symbol`

The ball is hollowed. This should save filament when printing a ball with a large `diameter`. 

It stands solid on the flat pole.
