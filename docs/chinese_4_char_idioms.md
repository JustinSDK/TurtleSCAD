# 4 char idioms - stereographic projection

As I said in [Stereographic projection maze](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2013536), I hit upon a great idea one day. If we waive the maze algorithm aside, there exists an easy way to perform a stereographic projection in OpenSCAD. 

I wrote a `stereographic_projection` which can perform stereographic projection for 2D graph. The customizer here is just a demonstration. If `stereographic_projection` interests you, you may find it in "chinese_4_char_idioms.scad". The `stereographic_projection` itself has only about twenty lines.

The `chinese_4_char_idioms` module is designed specifically for traditional-Chinese characters with the font "微軟正黑體". If you want to use other characters and their respective fonts, the `chinese_4_char_idioms` module could be a template.
