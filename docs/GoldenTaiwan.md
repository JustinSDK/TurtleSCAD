# Golden Taiwan

Is it golden? The 2D shape of [Taiwan](https://www.google.com.tw/maps/place/%E5%8F%B0%E7%81%A3/@23.5821098,118.7763543,7z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x346ef3065c07572f:0xe711f004bf9c5469!8m2!3d23.69781!4d120.960515) is extruded through the path of a golden spiral. The wave base is a golden rectangle. Golden Taiwan is not the current  state of Taiwan. The name also implies a wish. 

It's based on `golden_spiral_extrude` and `bezier_surface` modules of [my library](https://justinsdk.github.io/dotSCAD/). I used a 2D shape of Taiwan here; however, the `golden_spiral_extrude` module can extrude any 2D shape.
