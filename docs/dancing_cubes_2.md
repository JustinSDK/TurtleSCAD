# Dancing cubes ||

It's based on [Dancing cubes](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2122844).

You can upload a 100x100 png file and engrave the pattern on the top of the cubes. I also leave an option to hide the hinge pillars. The top plane is `spacing` (mm) higher than the top of the pillars. Printing it might be harder than the model which has visible pillars; however, you may challenge it.
