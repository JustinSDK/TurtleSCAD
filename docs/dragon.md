# Dragon

I created an [along_with](https://openhome.cc/eGossip/OpenSCAD/lib-along_with.html) module and wrote an example of dragon scales. Then, I thought: "Can I use OpenSCAD to model a dragon?"

The thing here is a proof of concept so its code is quick and dirty. It's not perfect but works. If you want to create something like this and don't know how to start from scratch, it might be a reference. 

The curve of the dragon body is created by the [bezier_curve](https://openhome.cc/eGossip/OpenSCAD/lib-bezier_curve.html) module. I leave the x coordinates of several control points as parameters for trying it in Customizer. If you change their values, the dragon will swing in different ways. 

There are other modules in the code. If you are interested in them, check my [dotSCAD](https://justinsdk.github.io/dotSCAD/) library.
