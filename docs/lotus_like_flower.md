# Lotus-like flower

It's my first attempt of using [Fibonacci sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number) to create a flower. 

The petals form a [golden spiral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_spiral) and several spirals form a flower. In the customizer, a larger `spirals` makes the petals density higher, and a larger `petals_per_spiral` generates a bigger flower. 

After generating or downloading a STL here, scale up it to the size that your printer can print the smallest petal. 

The printed thing here, for example, were enlarged to a scale of 1:3.5.
