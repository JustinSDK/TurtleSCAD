# CYL bear box

I made a gift for my friend, a professional picture book illustrator. Some of her works can be found on [her website](http://cargocollective.com/chenyingluillustration).

It's a thing similar to [Text box](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2194546). I published it as a customizable thing because it may be useful for someone else. If you have an STL such as [CYL_bear.STL](https://www.thingiverse.com/download:3628265) which has a corner at the origin, the source file can turn it into a box. 

The Thingiverse customizer doesn't accept STL file so you have to download [CYL_bear_box.scad](https://www.thingiverse.com/download:3628271) and change the `stl_file` to your STL. Of course, you also require to download and use [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/index.html) to render and export an STL.
