# Character tower generator

You may input any text to generate your own tower. For example, Ï€, root of 2, and so on. Of course, you may write a love letter and generate a tower for your lover. That might be a really special gift. :)

Numbers or uppercase letters is better. The number of letters determines the height of the tower. The more you input, the higher it is. 

If you want to print it easily, set the `inner_wall` parameter to `"YES"`. It will add an inner wall with the thickness of the half `thickness` value.

Just leave the `bottom_symbol` empty if you don't need the bottom symbol.

Using non English characters needs a correct font. If you want to do that, download the .scad source file and use OpenSCAD on your computer. You have to modify the source code of the `tower_of_characters` module according to the font you use. You may take a look at the `tower_of_chinese_characters` module for reference.
