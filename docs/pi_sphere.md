# PI sphere

I wrote a module which may position any module around a sphere. I exported a PI sphere first because it looks nice. 

The customizer here allows you to change `radius`, `style` and `thickness`. I'll publish a Customizer which may allow you to input your own characters another day because the program is still under adjustment.
