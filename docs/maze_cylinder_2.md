# Maze cylinder 2

I got a feature request in [the comment of Maze cylinder](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1229429/#comment-1493174). Here's the realization. If you want a thick/high wall and print it well, it will help. Try to adjust the `wall_top_scale` parameter to archive the ramp effect you want.
