# Melted clock

I saw [a topic](http://forum.openscad.org/quot-Melting-quot-models-td26391.html) about how to recreate something like [Melted Gear](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2872162) in OpenSCAD. Here's a demonstration.

The `melt` module is a generalized version for extruding and melting a circle-like shape. If you want to melt other shapes, try to modify its code.
