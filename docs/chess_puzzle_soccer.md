# Chess puzzle soccer

This is based on [Soccer puzzle](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1534279). It's a chess set. It's a puzzle.  It's a soccer. If you want to play chess, take the soccer apart. When you don't play, put it together again.

While I was putting pieces together, it looked like a helmet. That's why my daughter put it on Snoopy. 

The chess symbols need the font `"MS Gothic"` so you may not use the [Customizer](http://www.thingiverse.com/apps/customizer/run?thing_id=1547895) directly. You may download .scad file and use [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/). If you want to use different chess symbols, such as [Chess symbols in Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_symbols_in_Unicode), replace symbols in the `pieces` module.
