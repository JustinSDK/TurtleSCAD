# Buddha Duke

In Taiwan, the Buddha-like mindset somethings means that wishing a happy ending without any effort.

For example, Buddha-like development means a ridiculous software development process that some teams take. It has no specs, no coding, no testing, no reviewing, and etc. The project manager always imagines everything will be OK after the deadline.

Java is one of my familiar programming languages. Duke is the Java mascot. You can find its story on [Duke, the Java Mascot](https://www.oracle.com/java/duke.html).  

The thing here is a metaphor. If your team use Java and takes the Buddha-like development, you might really want to print one.
