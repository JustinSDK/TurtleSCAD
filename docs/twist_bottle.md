# Twist bottle

It's inspired by [Twist Vases](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2201766). I made it a bottle so that you may put something into it.

The customizer here provides only three shapes; however, the `twist_bottle` module inside the source file is generalized. You can use your own shape to create a twist bottle. The only thing should be noted is centering your shape at the origin.

At the height of 100mm, I only twist the bottle 180 degrees. You may try more degrees, such as 270 degrees. Twisting more will get more visual effects but affects the smoothness of spiraling down.
