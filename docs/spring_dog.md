# Spring Dog

I created [Slinky dog](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2385869) and [Slinky dog ||](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2409917) two years ago. From Wikipedia, a [Slinky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slinky) is a precompressed helical spring toy invented by Richard James in the early 1940s.

One day, one question emerged in my brain: how to create a not-precompressed  spring which can be easily printed by an FDM 3DP?
